      It was generated by:

        <li>Finding the most frequent words using a hashtable</li>
        <li>The code was written in Java</li>

        <label class="h3s">HashMap</label><br>
        The Data structure use to calculate the word frequenci is the HashMap because in this case I need to have the data in a key value pair format. one for the number of time a word happier and the second the word itself, and HashMap offert me that posibility. These Key value pair could be of any data type and we can even use generics to insert any type of data into it.<br>
        <label class="h3s">Improvement</label><br>
      This project for me is a very complet project including both web design, data structure and java open source library using The maven Packages Manager<br>If given more time for this project I woulb love to have a more well design and beautiful website. I would also like to say more about the project with more tools use to bult it<br>
      <label class="h3s">Context of the Song</label><br>
         I choose this sing because its a throught back song and it always remind me when my principle use to play it out laoud because he wanted us to change and believe this song will change us.<br>
        The song was a billboard top hit of Portrait of a Legend in both 1951 and 1964
        The top word found were <em>"i, a, but, been, know, long, is, it, oh, will" </em> and <em>"gonna"</em>. It is not suprising for someone who is already familiar with song in the sense where it a lot more about calling out for change regarding the social inequality<br>
